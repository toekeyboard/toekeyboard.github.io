<pre>
	Wire:
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5mm audio phone connector / audio jack (connection to cellphone)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)">(Tip-Ring-Sleeve, TRS connector)</a>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source:  +8 ft cable, double ended audio jack.  26-30 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge">AWG</a>. Left & Right channel encased in different sleeves)

	Aluminum foil (for contact pads):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7/8)" x 1"   (x4)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source:  aluminum foil from kitchen, normally used for baking/bbq)

	Plastic (for insulator between contact pads):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1" x 1"(1/2)"	(x2)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if aluminum contacts are sticking together, increase thickness with multiple plastic layers)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: think plastic bag from any food packaging)

	Tape (to bind contact pads and insulator together):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: 2" wide duck tape)

	String (to secure pads to big toes)	(x2)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: wide packing string, more comfortable)

Statistics & Measurements
---
<pre>
	Heavy-duty Barbecue strength 25' Aluminum Foil
		45.6 cm x 7.6 m = 3.5m^2
		18 in x 25 ft = 37.5 sq ft
		18 in x 25 ft x (12 in / 1 ft) = 5400 sq in

	Square contact pads (x4)
		1 in x (7/8) in = (7/8) sq in
		(7/8) sq in x 4 = 3.5 sq in

	Number of toekeyboard that can be produced from a single roll of aluminum foil
		5400 sq in / 3.5 sq in = 1542.857...
		Therefore, can produce 1542 toekeyboards

Steps
---

<pre>
	1. Cut 8 ft+ double ended audio cable in half.  Strip ends, expose 1" wire.   (akes two toe keyboards, each 4 ft long)  
	2. Cut four aluminum foil pads ((7/8)" x 1")
	3. Punch hole through all four aluminum foil pads (with pin / sewing needle / thumbtack) ( (1/2)" from side; (1/4)" from bottom )
	4. Put exposed copper wires through holes.  Bend wires, loop at bottom.  Solder in place.
	5. Cut two plastics pads (1" x 1"(1/2)")
	6. Cut holes through them with scissors.  (Center: (1/2)" from side; (5/8)" from top. Diameter: approximately (3/8)")
	7. Make toe keyboard pads
		i. Lie one aluminum pad and wire on tape
		ii. Lie plastic pad on top
		iii. Lie alumium pad on plastic pad
		iv. Wrap tape around pads
		v. Wrap tape around paper, for additional protection / advertising / instructions.
		v. Tape string to one side.  (String 8" long)
		vi. Repeat for second pad
