	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source:  ethernet cable.  contains 8 wires.  Only need 4 of them)

	Aluminum foil (for contact pads):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7/8)" x 1"(1/4)"   (x4)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source:  aluminum foil from kitchen, normally used for baking/bbq)

	Plastic (for insulator between contact pads):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1" x 1"(3/4)"	(x2)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if aluminum contacts are sticking together, increase thickness with multiple plastic layers)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: think plastic bag from any food packaging)

	Tape (to bind contact pads and insulator together):
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: 2" wide duck tape)

	Elastic bands (to secure pads to big toes)	(x2)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(source: thin elastic bands usually wrapping scallion / green onions together)


<b>----Tools needed</b>
	Ruler
	Pen / marker
	Scissor / Exacto knife  
	Duck tape
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_pin">Pin / sewing needle / thumbtack</a> 
	Lighter / matches (to burn off protective coating off headphones/earbud wires)
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (optional: Soldering iron & solder (to solder wires together) )


<b>----Steps</b>
	1. Strip ethernet cable(cut off ethernet protective casing around wires).  Strip wire ends
	2. Cut four aluminum foil pads ((7/8)" x 1"(1/4)")
	3. Punch hole through all four aluminum foil pads (with pin / sewing needle / thumbtack) ( (1/2)" from side; (1/4)" from bottom )
	4. Put exposed copper wires through holes.  Bend wires
	5. Cut two plastics pads (1" x 1"(3/4)")
	6. Cut holes through them with scissors.  (Center: (1/2)" from side; (5/8)" from top. Diameter: approximately (3/8)")
	7. Make toe keyboard pads
		i.Lie one aluminum pad and wire on tape
		ii. Lie plastic pad on top
		iii. Lie alumium pad on plastic pad
		iv. Finish wrapping tape around all pads
		v. Cut out small triangles on sides of pad.  Fit elastic band around them
		vi. Repeat for second pad
	8. Cut old headphones / earbuds off (leaving maximum length of wire, and audio jack). Strip wire ends
	9. Burn off protective coatings off headphone / earbud wires with lighter
